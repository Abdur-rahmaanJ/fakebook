# fakebook

Non-object oriented experiment building the core mechanics of a social media platform. Timeline view, add posts, log in or create a new account, follow users, ignore users. Each user receives a unique user ID.

Todo:  
  Password strength validation  
  scrolling forward and back pages  
  deleting posts  
  
eventually re-create as object oriented program.
