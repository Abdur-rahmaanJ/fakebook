# fakebook

Non-object oriented experiment building the core mechanics of a social media platform. Timeline view, add posts, log in or create a new account, follow users, ignore users. Each user receives a unique user ID.

Todo:
  Password strength validation  
  unable to follow and ignore the same user  
  remove ability to add users to ignore/follow list twice  
  timestamp each post(posts already collecting timestamp, just not showing)  
  pagination, showing only 10 most recent posts  
  scrolling forward and back pages  
  deleting posts  
  edit password, username  
  edit number of posts per page  
  
eventually re-create as object oriented program.
