# fakebook

Non-object oriented experiment building the core mechanics of a social media platform. Timeline view, add posts, log in or create a new account, follow users, ignore users. Each user receives a unique user ID.

Todo:  
  -deleting posts  
  -port JSON data storage to SQLITE(in progress)  
  -insert lots of fake data(in progress)  
  
eventually re-create as object oriented program.
